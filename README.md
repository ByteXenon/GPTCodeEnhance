## Privacy üîí

This extension is both free and open source. It respects your privacy and does not collect any data from users. The only information that is sent to the server is the specific code that you explicitly select during the execution of one of the extension's commands. This selected code is then sent through a third-party GPT-3.5-turbo API for improvement. The API is not owned or controlled by me, and I have no control over its data collection practices. For this reason, it is recommended to avoid sending private or proprietary code through the API to ensure the security of your codebase.

## License

This extension is released under the AGPL-3 License. See **[AGPL-3](LICENSE)** for details.
